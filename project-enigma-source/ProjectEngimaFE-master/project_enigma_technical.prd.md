- **Chat Interface:** CopilotKit native components with built-in streaming
- **State Management:** CopilotKit session management + JSON file persistence
- **API Integrations:** PyGithub + python-jira + atlassian-python-api (with mock alternatives)
- **Authentication:** Environment variable-based API tokens
- **Deployment:** Docker + Docker Compose for development
- **Monitoring:** Structured logging + health endpoints
- **Testing:** pytest + React Testing Library + CopilotKit testing utilities

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity:** Complete hackathon-ready system within timeline with zero custom chat development
- **Code Quality:** 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive error handling
- **User Experience:** <2 second response time for UI interactions, <30 second workflow execution, professional chat interface
- **Reliability:** Graceful handling of all API failure scenarios with clear error messaging through CopilotKit
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns with easy mock-to-real API switching and CopilotKit abstraction

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Single concurrent user for hackathon demonstration
- Mock APIs initially with real API integration capability
- Local file system for persistence (no external database required)
- Standard GitHub/JIRA/Confluence API rate limits and permissions
- Development environment: Windows PowerShell with Docker support
- CopilotKit handles all chat interface complexity and streaming implementation
