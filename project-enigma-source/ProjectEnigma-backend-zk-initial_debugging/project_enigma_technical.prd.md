| NTR008         | Deployment Automation               | As a developer, I want to implement automated deployment so the system can be easily deployed to various environments. | Docker deployment with environment-specific configurations and deployment scripts for local and cloud environments.  |

## Technical Architecture Summary

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **Backend:** FastAPI + LangGraph + Python 3.12+ + Uvicorn
- **State Management:** In-memory + JSON file persistence
- **API Integrations:** PyGithub + python-jira + atlassian-python-api (with mock alternatives)
- **Authentication:** Environment variable-based API tokens
- **Deployment:** Docker + Docker Compose for development
- **Monitoring:** Structured logging + health endpoints
- **Testing:** pytest + React Testing Library

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity:** Complete hackathon-ready system within timeline
- **Code Quality:** 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive error handling
- **User Experience:** <2 second response time for UI interactions, <30 second workflow execution
- **Reliability:** Graceful handling of all API failure scenarios with clear error messaging
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns with easy mock-to-real API switching

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Single concurrent user for hackathon demonstration
- Mock APIs initially with real API integration capability
- Local file system for persistence (no external database required)
- Standard GitHub/JIRA/Confluence API rate limits and permissions
- Development environment: Windows PowerShell with Docker support
