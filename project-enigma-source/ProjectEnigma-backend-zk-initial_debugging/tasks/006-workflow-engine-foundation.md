# 006 - Workflow Engine Foundation

## Overview
Establish the LangGraph workflow engine with state management, node structure, and basic orchestration framework.

## Deliverables
- LangGraph StateGraph setup and configuration
- Workflow state TypedDict definitions
- Basic node structure and execution framework
- Workflow state management and persistence
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Requirements Addressed
- LTR001: Workflow State Definition
- LTR012: Workflow Orchestration Graph
- DTR003: Workflow State Management
- ETR002: Workflow Error Recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- LangGraph workflow can be initialized and executed
- Workflow state properly flows between nodes
- Error conditions are captured and handled gracefully
- Workflow execution can be monitored and controlled
- State persistence allows workflow resumption after failures
