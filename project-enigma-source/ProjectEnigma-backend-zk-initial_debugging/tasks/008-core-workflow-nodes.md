# 008 - Core Workflow Nodes Implementation

## Overview
Implement the main workflow nodes for JIRA ticket collection, branch discovery, merge validation, and branch operations.

## Deliverables
- JIRA ticket collection node with fix version filtering
- Feature branch discovery node with pattern matching
- Merge status validation node
- Sprint branch merging node with conflict detection
- Release branch creation with semantic versioning
- Pull request generation node

## Technical Requirements Addressed
- LTR002: JIRA Ticket Collection Node
- LTR003: Feature Branch Discovery Node
- LTR004: Merge Status Validation Node
- LTR006: Sprint Branch Merging Node
- LTR007: Release Branch Creation Node
- LTR008: Pull Request Generation Node
- LTR009: Release Tagging Node
- LTR010: Rollback Branch Creation Node

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each node processes workflow state correctly
- JIRA tickets are filtered and collected by fix version
- Feature branches are discovered using standardized naming
- Merge conflicts are detected and reported
- Release branches follow semantic versioning conventions
- Pull requests are created with proper metadata
