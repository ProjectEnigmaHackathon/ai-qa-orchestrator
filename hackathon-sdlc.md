AI x SDLC


Overview
Welcome to the “AI x SDLC” Hackathon! This event challenges participants to explore and create AI-powered tools that automate, enhance, or augment any phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). From writing code and generating tests to reviewing PRs and monitoring performance, this is your chance to reimagine how software is built with AI as a true teammate.


Background Story
Following the success of our previous AI Agents Hackathon, we saw incredible innovation in autonomous agents and real-world AI applications. Now, with the growing integration of AI into daily developer workflows, it’s time to take it further.
This hackathon is focused on practical, SDLC-focused automation. The goal is to build smart systems that can simplify or accelerate SDLC tasks, boost productivity, and elevate software quality.


Rules & Guidelines
	•	SDLC Focus: Your project must target any stage of the SDLC (e.g., Requirements, Coding, Testing, CI/CD, Monitoring).
	•	Technology Freedom: Use any language, platform, or model (OpenAI, open source, custom).
	•	Innovation Encouraged: Go beyond existing tools. Don’t just clone Copilot or
ChatGPT-based scripts.
	•	Team Up: Cross-functional teams with developers, QA, DevOps, and AI enthusiasts are welcome.
	•	No Customer Project Overlap: Submissions must not be based on work already being developed for a customer.
	•	Deliverables:
	•	Working demo (mandatory)
	•	Architecture diagram or flow overview
	•	Short write-up on use case and value



QA Participation: AI Quality Champions
QA team members are critical to this hackathon. We encourage QA to collaborate with developers to evaluate and enhance the AI solutions.
Here’s how QA can actively contribute:
	•	Measure Output Quality: Use AI testing tools (e.g., Promptfoo, LangSmith, Traceloop) to evaluate accuracy, consistency, and hallucination risks.
	•	Validate AI Behavior: Design tests for expected/unexpected input, edge cases, and risk scenarios.
	•	Benchmark Performance: Define SLAs for latency, memory, cost, and model behavior under load.
	•	Explore Safety & Reliability: Check how the system behaves when inputs are incomplete, ambiguous, or adversarial.
QA teams understand risk better than anyone. Let’s bring that mindset to AI and make it production-grade.
DevOps Participation: Automate, Optimize, Enable

DevOps plays a key role in turning AI ideas into scalable, production-ready solutions. Whether it's streamlining pipelines, enhancing observability, or supporting deployment, there’s plenty of room to innovate.
Here are a few ways DevOps can contribute:
	•	Smarter CI/CD: Use AI to detect flaky steps, reduce build times, or auto-tune workflows.
	•	AI for Observability: Summarize logs, detect anomalies, or predict performance drift.
	•	Incident Response: Cluster alerts, suggest root causes, or build AI-powered on-call assistants.
	•	Enablement: Help teams test, monitor, and ship their AI tools safely.


Bring your automation mindset and let’s push the boundaries of what DevOps can do with
AI.






What Kind of Solutions to Build?
Here are some example ideas to spark your imagination:
	•	Test Case Generator: Converts user stories, requirements, or code into unit/integration tests.
	•	PR Review Assistant: AI agent that reviews code for quality, standards, and risky changes.
	•	AI Bug Triage Agent: Clusters crash logs or error reports and suggests root causes.
	•	CI/CD Optimizer: Analyzes pipeline history to suggest bottlenecks and flaky steps.
	•	Performance Drift Detector: Detects latency spikes or changes in key KPIs over time.
	•	Smart Code Explainer: Summarizes logic or architecture for new devs or onboarding.
	•	Release Impact Predictor: Identifies potential impact of code changes using dependency graphs.
	•	Large File Refactoring: Use AI to refactor long, complex files into manageable, modular components.
	•		Large File Test Case Generator: Automatically generate test cases for large files or legacy systems.
	•		PRD Generator: Convert requirements or discussions into well-structured Product Requirement Documents.
	•	Cross-Language Code Rewriter: Translate codebases from one language or framework to another (e.g., Python to Go, or JavaScript to TypeScript).


Evaluation Criteria
	•	Relevance to SDLC: Does the solution target a real development pain point?
	•	Level of Automation: How much of the task is offloaded to AI?
	•	Innovation & Uniqueness: Is this solving a new problem or in a new way?
	•	Technical Completeness: Does the demo work well? Is it robust?
	•	Performance & Observability: Are metrics captured and interpreted meaningfully?


Build What You Want!
Don’t limit yourself to predefined ideas. Think of what slows you down as a developer or tester — and then solve it. Let’s push the boundaries of what AI can do in software development.



Join us in redefining the future of development. Automate the boring. Amplify the smart. Build the next-gen SDLC tools!
